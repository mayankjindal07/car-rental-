        iDRIVE is providing UNLIMITED KILOMETERS with NO FUEL Bookings, but the Guests are expected to drop the car at an equal or higher fuel level than the Booking Start time. Reimbursement for any excess fuel will be processed to the Guests. Refuelling Charges will be levied if the vehicle is dropped at a lower fuel level than the Booking Start time. If the booking type is With-fuel, iDRIVE pays for the fuel, regardless of whether the vehicle is a diesel or petrol variant. iDRIVE refuels the vehicles regularly. If you are driving a long distance and you need to refuel the vehicle, keep the original fuel receipt and submit it after your reservation and iDRIVE will happily reimburse you the amount based on estimation. We do not reimburse fuel refund on No fuel bookings, Please refuel the vehicles as per your need. While ending the trip vehicle fuel % should be as same as the start fuel % to avoid unnecessary charges. Start & End Checklist is mandatory.      </div>
